<span class="ph">When you define a <a href="../glossary/gdef_rollup_measure.html" title="&#xA;        ROLLUP is a modifier to an aggregate expression that allows you&#xA;            to define complex measure expressions, such as windowed, partitioned, or&#xA;                adaptive measure expressions. This is useful when you want to compute an&#xA;            aggregation for a subset of rows within the overall result of a viz query. It allows you&#xA;            to compute things such as running totals, moving averages, benchmark comparisons, rank&#xA;            ordering, percentiles, and so on.&#xA;       &#xA;    "><dfn class="term">ROLLUP measure</dfn></a> computed field, the                 partitioning criteria of the <samp class="ph codeph">ROLLUP</samp> expression can be fixed or                 adaptive. You can either partition by an exact field name (fixed), a reference field                 name (adaptive), or no field name at all (adaptive). Using a reference field allows                 the partitioning criteria to dynamically adapt to any field of the referenced                 dataset that is used in the viz. For example, if the partition field is a reference                 field pointing to the <em class="ph i">Date</em> dimension, the adaptive measure can be used to                 partition by any sub-field of <em class="ph i">Date</em> (<em class="ph i">Week</em>, <em class="ph i">Month</em>, <em class="ph i">Year</em>,                 and so on).</span></li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../glossary/gdef_lens_aggregate.html">aggregate lens</a></strong><br/>
An aggregate lens contains a selection of measure and dimension fields chosen             from the focal point of a single fact dataset. A completed or built lens can be thought             of as a table that contains aggregated measure data values grouped by the selected             dimension values. An aggregate lens can be built from any dataset. There are no special             data modeling requirements to build an aggregate lens. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../glossary/gdef_aggregation.html">aggregation</a></strong><br/>
<span class="ph">An aggregation is the result of a function that takes                 all values of a numeric column, and returns a single value of more significant                 meaning or measurement. An aggregate function groups the values of multiple rows                 together based on some defined input expression.</span></li>

<span class="ph">Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR) is a Hadoop framework                 hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It utilizes Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud                 (Amazon EC2) for compute resources and Amazon Simple Storage Service (<a href="../glossary/gdef_amazon_s3.html" title="&#xA;        Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a data storage&#xA;                service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).&#xA;        It is a distributed file system hosted by Amazon where you pay a monthly fee for storage&#xA;            space and data transfer bandwidth. Data transfer is free between S3 and Amazon Elastic&#xA;            Compute Cloud (EC2) clusters, making S3 an attractive choice for users who run Hadoop&#xA;            clusters on AWS or utilize the Amazon EMR service. &#xA;        Hadoop supports two S3 file system protocols as an alternative to HDFS: S3 Native File System (s3n) and S3 Block File System (s3).&#xA;            Platfora supports the S3 Native File System (s3n) only. &#xA;    "><dfn class="term">Amazon S3</dfn></a>) for data storage.</span></li>

<span class="ph">Apache Avro is a remote procedure call (RPC) and data                 serialization framework. Its primary use is to provide a data serialization format                 for persistent data stored in Hadoop.</span></li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../glossary/gdef_discrete.html">categorical</a></strong><br/>
<span class="ph">Categorical data is data with unconnected data points that                 can be represented in a visualization as a categorical grouping or individual data                 point. Categorical data is countable and often finite (for example, the number of                 products sold or the number of people in a city).</span> In Platfora, categorical             values in a visualization are evenly spaced by sort order. By default, dimension fields             in a visualization are categorical, but numeric or datetime dimensions can be changed to             quantitative. Categorical data is sometimes referred to as discrete data.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../glossary/gdef_column.html">column</a></strong><br/>
<span class="ph">A column is a set of data values of a particular data type,                 with one value for each row in the dataset. Columns provide the structure for                 composing a row. The terms column and <a href="../glossary/gdef_field.html" title="&#xA;        A field is an atomic unit of data that has a name, a value, a&#xA;                data type, and a role of either dimension or measure. When working with visualizations, fields are the same&#xA;                thing as the dimensions and measures used to analyze the data. &#xA;        Fields describe a single aspect of a record (or row) in a dataset. An order record, for example, might contain an order date field, a product name field, a quantity field, and so on. All records in a dataset have exactly the same fields, although the values in each field vary from record to record.&#xA;        &#xA;    "><dfn class="term">field</dfn></a>﻿ are often used                 interchangeably, although many consider it more correct to use field to refer                 specifically to the single item that exists at the intersection of one row and one                 column.</span></li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../glossary/gdef_computed_field.html">computed field</a></strong><br/>
<span class="ph">A computed field generates its values based on a                 calculation or condition, and returns a value for each input row. Values are                 computed based on expressions that can contain values from other fields, constants,                 mathematical operators, comparison operators, or built-in row functions.</span></li>

Once a lens is built, this prepared&#xA;                data is copied to Platfora, where it is available for analysis. A lens can be&#xA;                thought of as a dynamic, on-demand data mart purpose-built for a specific analysis&#xA;                project.&#xA;        Platfora generates MapReduce jobs to pull the&#xA;            requested data from the Hadoop source system, and prepares the data for fast, ad-hoc&#xA;            visual analysis. As users build visualizations, lens data is loaded into memory on a&#xA;            column-by-column basis as it is needed. &#xA;        &#xA;            &#xA;        &#xA;        Platfora has two types of lenses you can build: an aggregate lens or an event series&#xA;                lens.

Quantitative fields usually have values that can                 be shown in ordered progression, such as height, speed, or duration                 measurements.</span> Quantitative values are placed on a continuous axis, always             displayed from low to high. In Platfora, measure data is always quantitative, but             numeric or datetime dimensions can be either quantitative or categorical. Quantitative             data is sometimes referred to as continuous data.</li>
